# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my SQL skills and projects! In this README, I'll provide an overview of my SQL expertise and highlight some of my key projects.

## SQL Skills and Expertise

I have delved deep into the world of SQL, mastering essential concepts such as:

- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Creating and managing database schemas.
- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- **DCL (Data Control Language):** Managing permissions and security.
- **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Controlling transactions.
- **CTE (Common Table Expressions):** Creating recursive and non-recursive CTEs for complex queries.
- **Subqueries:** Writing subqueries to retrieve specific data.
- **Temporary Tables:** Using temporary tables for intermediate results.
- **Views:** Creating and using views to simplify complex queries.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions:** Developing reusable database routines.
- **Index Implementation:** Improving query performance with indexing.
- **Database Building:** Designing and building relational databases.
- **Project Management:** Implementing Agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban) for effective project management.

## SQL Projects

### Ad Hoc Analysis for Various Business Domains üìä

I have created several SQL advanced ad hoc analyses for various business domains, including:

- Finance
- Marketing
- Sales
- Supply Chain
- Management Information Systems (MIS)

For each project, I applied a structured approach, breaking the process down into smaller chunks:

- **Database Development:** Creating a well-structured database schema.
- **Relationships and Cardinalities:** Defining relationships between tables and cardinalities.
- **Joins:** Writing complex joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** Using CTEs for recursive or complex queries.
- **Views:** Creating views for simplified data access.
- **Functions, Triggers, and Stored Procedures:** Developing database routines for automation and data consistency.
- **Calculated Columns:** Adding calculated columns to facilitate analysis.
- **Constraints:** Implementing constraints for data integrity.

### Atliq Hardware Company Project üè≠

One of my standout projects was for Atliq Hardware Company, where I applied SQL concepts to solve real-world business problems. This project demonstrated my ability to provide practical solutions using SQL. I covered aspects such as:

- Inventory Management
- Sales Analysis
- Customer Relationship Management
- Supply Chain Optimization
